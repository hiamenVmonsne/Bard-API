If you are looking for a free download of Autodesk Mechanical Desktop 2012, you may be disappointed to find out that this software is no longer available from the official Autodesk website. However, there are some alternative ways to get this software for free, such as:
 
- Downloading it from a third-party website that offers free software downloads. However, this method is not recommended as it may expose your computer to viruses, malware, or other security risks. You should always check the reputation and reliability of the website before downloading anything from it. One example of such a website is [Free Download Manager](https://en.freedownloadmanager.org/users-choice/Autodesk_Mechanical_Desktop_2012.html), which claims to offer a free download of Autodesk Mechanical Desktop 2012[^1^]. However, we cannot confirm the validity or safety of this download link.
- Using a previous version of Autodesk software that includes Mechanical Desktop as a component. If you have a subscription or a perpetual license for an older version of Autodesk software, such as AutoCAD 2017 or earlier, you may be able to download Mechanical Desktop as part of your product package. You can use the [Autodesk Assistant](https://www.autodesk.com/support/download-install/individuals/configure-install/download-previous-versions) to find and download previous versions of Autodesk software[^4^]. You will need your serial number and product key to access the download link.
- Using a free student version of a similar software that offers mechanical design features. If you are a student or an educator, you may be eligible to download and use some of the free engineering software offered by [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/en-in/academic/students), a company that provides simulation solutions for various industries[^3^]. One of the software products that you can download for free is Ansys Mechanical, which allows you to perform structural analysis, thermal analysis, modal analysis, and more. You will need to register with your academic email address and agree to the terms and conditions to access the download link.

We hope this article has helped you find some ways to download Autodesk Mechanical Desktop 2012 for free. However, we advise you to exercise caution and discretion when downloading any software from unofficial sources, as they may not be authorized, updated, or secure.
  
Autodesk Mechanical Desktop 2012 is a legacy software that was discontinued by Autodesk in 2009. It was replaced by Autodesk Inventor, a more advanced and comprehensive software for mechanical design and engineering. Autodesk Inventor offers many features and benefits that Mechanical Desktop does not, such as:

- Parametric modeling: Autodesk Inventor allows you to create and edit 3D models based on parameters and constraints that define their shape and size. You can also use sketching tools, direct editing tools, and freeform modeling tools to create complex and organic shapes.
- Assembly design: Autodesk Inventor enables you to create and manage large assemblies of parts and subassemblies. You can also use assembly features, such as joints, constraints, patterns, and mirroring, to define the relationships and motion between components.
- Simulation and analysis: Autodesk Inventor provides you with various tools to test and validate your designs before manufacturing. You can perform stress analysis, dynamic simulation, motion analysis, fluid flow analysis, thermal analysis, and more.
- Documentation and presentation: Autodesk Inventor helps you to create professional-quality drawings, animations, renderings, and exploded views of your designs. You can also use the integrated AutoCAD functionality to create 2D drawings from your 3D models.

If you are interested in upgrading from Mechanical Desktop to Inventor, you can visit the [Autodesk Inventor website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/inventor/overview) to learn more about the product features, pricing, and system requirements. You can also download a free trial version of Inventor to test it out for yourself.
  
In conclusion, Autodesk Mechanical Desktop 2012 is a software that is no longer supported or available from the official Autodesk website. However, there are some alternative ways to get this software for free, such as downloading it from a third-party website, using a previous version of Autodesk software that includes Mechanical Desktop as a component, or using a free student version of a similar software that offers mechanical design features. However, we advise you to exercise caution and discretion when downloading any software from unofficial sources, as they may not be authorized, updated, or secure. We also recommend you to consider upgrading to Autodesk Inventor, a more advanced and comprehensive software for mechanical design and engineering.
